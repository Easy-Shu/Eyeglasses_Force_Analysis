# Temple Clamping Force Modelling for Eyeglasses Design
A key factor in determining the comfort level of eyeglasses is the clamping force at the temple. However, how to estimate the clamping force remains under-explored. Hence, to address this gap, we developed a mathematical model to calculate the clamping force ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?F) of the temples based on eyeglasses parameters (including length ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?L), displacement ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?d), and flexural rigidity ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?EI) of the temples).

Regression results of physical dataset for plastic temples. (a) plastic eyeglasses samples. (b) multiple regression result for superposed displacement: ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?d=0.0316F\cdot{L^3}+0.0618F\cdot{L}). (c) linear regression result for temple displacement: ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?d=0.1125F\cdot{L^3}).
