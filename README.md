# Temple Clamping Force Modelling for Eyeglasses Design
A key factor in determining the comfort level of eyeglasses is the clamping force at the temple. However, how to estimate the clamping force remains under-explored. Hence, to address this gap, we developed a mathematical model to calculate the clamping force of the temples based on eyeglasses parameters (including length, displacement, and flexural rigidity of the temples).
